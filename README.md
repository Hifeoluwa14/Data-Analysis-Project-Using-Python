# Data Analysis with Python

This project focuses on data analysis of a messy and raw dataset from EA Sports' FIFA 21 using Python.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), contains detailed information about players in EA Sports' FIFA 21. It includes **18,979 rows** and **77 columns**, featuring attributes such as player positions, wages, value, release clauses, and many more performance and contract details.

## Data Analysis Steps

Understanding the dataset is a crucial step in the data analysis process. I took time to understand the dataset and set up series of questions that could be answered by the dataset. Since the dataset is in a very raw form it requires a very through data cleaning.

Here are the steps I took in cleaning the dataset:


* Removed duplicate entries
* Handled missing values
* Converted data types appropriately
* Parsed and normalized monetary values (e.g., wages, release clauses)
* Extracted and cleaned player attributes
* Standardized text formatting

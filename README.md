# Data Analysis with Python

This project focuses on data analysis of a messy and raw dataset from EA Sports' FIFA 21 using Python.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), contains detailed information about players in EA Sports' FIFA 21. It includes **18,979 rows** and **77 columns**, featuring attributes such as player positions, wages, value, release clauses, and many more performance and contract details.

Understanding the dataset is a crucial step in the data cleaning process to ensure the right techniques are applied to make it analysis-ready.

## Data Cleaning Steps

\[Add bullet points or a list here describing the cleaning steps you performed, such as:]

* Removed duplicate entries
* Handled missing values
* Converted data types appropriately
* Parsed and normalized monetary values (e.g., wages, release clauses)
* Extracted and cleaned player attributes
* Standardized text formatting

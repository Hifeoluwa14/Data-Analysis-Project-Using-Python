##  Process  

### **Data Cleaning**  
- **Split Columns**: Separated `Team` and `Contract` into  `club` and `contract_type`.  
- **Standardized Units**:  
  - Converted `height` from feet/inches to inches.  
  - Removed "lbs" from `weight` for numerical analysis.  
- **Normalized Monetary Values**:  
  - Replaced "K" and "M" in `wage`, `value`, and `release_clause` with numerics(e.g., "‚Ç¨5K" ‚Üí 5000).  
- **Cleaned Ratings**: Removed stars (‚òÖ) from `W/F`, `SM`, and `IR` columns.  
- **Renamed columns**: Renamed a few columns for easier undertstanding of what it represents
- **Standardize Column names** - Lowercases all column names  
- **Removed Columns**: Dropped irrelevant columns (`photo_url`, `player_url`) and duplicates.
- **Removed Duplicates** - Dropped duplicated rows from dataset  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Used visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to explore:  
  - Distributions of wages, ages, and ratings.  
  - Correlations between attributes (e.g., `height` vs. `strength`).  
  - Club/nationality-based trends.

## üîç Key Findings  
*(Summarize your most interesting insights here. Example:)*  
- **Top Club**: "Manchester City" has the most players (X), while "XYZ" has the fewest (Y).
  ![Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)
- **Wage Disparity**: Player XYZ is underpaid (wage = ‚Ç¨A, rating = B).  
- **Physical Traits**: Taller players show a weak/moderate correlation (R¬≤ = X) with `overall_rating`.  
- **Highest-Paid Position**: Strikers (ST) earn ~‚Ç¨X on average; goalkeepers (GK) earn the least.

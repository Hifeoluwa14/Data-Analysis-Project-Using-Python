##  Process  

### **Data Cleaning**  
- **Split Columns**: Separated `Team` and `Contract` into  `club` and `contract_type`.  
- **Standardized Units**:  
  - Converted `height` from feet/inches to inches.  
  - Removed "lbs" from `weight` for numerical analysis.  
- **Normalized Monetary Values**:  
  - Replaced "K" and "M" in `wage`, `value`, and `release_clause` with numerics(e.g., "‚Ç¨5K" ‚Üí 5000).  
- **Cleaned Ratings**: Removed stars (‚òÖ) from `W/F`, `SM`, and `IR` columns.  
- **Renamed columns**: Renamed a few columns for easier undertstanding of what it represents
- **Standardize Column names** - Lowercases all column names  
- **Removed Columns**: Dropped irrelevant columns (`photo_url`, `player_url`) and duplicates.
- **Removed Duplicates** - Dropped duplicated rows from dataset

 - ST- finishing, ball control, reactions, positioning, shooting, composure.
- CT- short_passing, dribbling, ball_control, reactions, vision, composure, reactions
- RW - finishing, short_passing, dribbling, ball_control, reactions, long_shots, positioning, vision, composure, shooting, passing
- LW - finishing, short_passing, dribbling, ball_control, acceleration, sprint_speed, agility, reactions, positioning, vision, composure, pace, shooting
- CAM - crossing, short_passing,	volleys, ball_control, reactions, positioning, vision, shooting, passing
- CM - short passing, long passing, vision, reactions
- LM- ball controling, positioning, vision, composure, shooting

## üîç Key Observation  
- **Most Valuable Player**: The most valuable player in this dataset is Mbappe.
- **Wage Disparity**: There are couple of players with relatively high value that earn really little compare to thier counterpat.  
- **Overall rating, value, wage**: The relationship between these variables is high.
- **Best Team**: The nation with the top players based on overall rating is Spain.
- **Highest-Paid Position**: Strikers (ST) earn most on average; goalkeepers (GK) earn the least.
- **Attribute relationship with positions**: Reactions is an important attribute across all position for a player. For Goalkeepers diving, positioning, relexes are important attribute. For attackers (ST, CF, LW, RW) finishing, positioning, ball control are important attributes for overall rating. For Midfielders(CAM, CM, CDM, LM, RM) vision, ball control, positioning and passing are important attributes while for Defenders(CB, RB, LB, LWB, RWB) we could say passing, interceptions, standing tackle are important attributes.
